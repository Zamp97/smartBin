# smartBin
## IOT smart bin project

The purpose of this project is to design a simulation of a smart trash bin, which, when it is full or
foul smelling, notifies the user about the timely removal of the garbage.
For the simulation, it was decided to use the TinkerCAD cloud service with
Arduino support. Its distinctive features are openness, free access, rich editor
functionality. We used several sensors to make smart trash work properly: a
distance sensor, a temperature sensor, and a gas sensor (see chapter 2 for details).
To notify the user about a full trash can, we decided to use the Tningspeak
service. Key features of this platform: ThingSpeak allows to combine, visualize
and analyze streams of real data in the cloud. This service allows you to visualize
the results of work (in the form of graphs) of the sensors used in real time. A
detailed description of the use of this service is also presented in Chapter 3, where
we also described the solution to the problem of the lack of a Wi-Fi module in
TinkerCAD.
In the last two chapters of the report, we described the results of the project
and suggested future improvements for the project. As a result, the smart trash
bin simulation has been successfully implemented.
